        <p id="message">Ahhh,so 22 years now? But it is very sad I got to be with you in only 4 of them,but I hope it's fine because I will get to celebrate all the other upcoming birthdays of you in sha Allah. Oyshi, you are the most decorated and perfect person I have ever met and I feel so ecstatic joyous and delighted to call you mine and trust me it really feels so surreal to think how I could make you mine alhamdulillah. You know that how much I love you and how much you mean to me. Honestly you mean everything to me and I love everything about you honeyy. I love the way you smile,you look at me,how you are passionate about the things you love (yes I am included in that too). I really want to have a future with you in sha Allah bbg and I pray for you to have an amazing career out of Psychology and become the great counsellor,mentor and life saver to the world like you have been to me and to YOURSELF. I never appreciated this with written words but guess I will not miss the opportunity this time. I AM REALLY VERY PROUD OF YOUU for making way of just surviving your tough phases and existing in front of me and to this deadly yet beautiful world. You know you are one of the many and first reasons I can call this world beautiful and liveworthy. Thank you for surviving through it and make thousands more survive in sha Allah. Allah really made human for human and you are "The" human for me alhamdulillah. I just cannot stop writing you. You are the best ,the absolutely best thing that can ever happen to me alhamdulillah. I guess you are my reward to being kind to people and some of my good deeds alhamdulillah (I might be very bad but at least I have done some goods at leastðŸ˜…). Some last words,Oyshi,I want you to believe in yourself and show the world who you are and what you are capable of. I can see an igniting potential and possibilities in you and your 22nd and the rest is going to be the years of sparking the fire in sha Allah and go on to conquer the world in sha Allah. And I will always be there beside you in your every step of life in sha Allah. And no matter what I will always love you in sha Allah and be there to hold your hand in the coldest nights of winter and always wrap you around to shield you from every difficulties.

        And lastly I have tried to make everything as special as I could this time and this inept website is one of them,this is literally my first ever website alhamdulillah and it is for you,love. I love youuuuuuuu soo soo muchh. Oh hae I know this website is not well made at all,This is the best I could do for now in the very short period of my learning. In sha Allah promise to make even better websites for you and in sha Allah I will make your first ever website for psycotherapy related startup you start someday in sha Allah. Doing these for free but kamano shuru korle kintu amio bhag boshabo bole dilamm.</p>
